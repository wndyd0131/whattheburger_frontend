# Whataburger Redesign - Fullstack Clone (Unofficial)

## Overview
This is a fullstack web application simulating a fast food ordering system of Whataburger, rebuilt with modern technologies to enhance usability and maintainability.

Features include:
* User-friendly homepage
* Single Page Application (SPA)
* Role-based system (Admin, Employer, User, Guest) 
* Clear and readable order customization interface
* Cart management for both guests and logged-in users
* User authentication and session management
* Responsive design

**Note:** This is a self-initiated project created to explore real-world web application structure and is not affiliated with Whataburger.

## Motivation
The project was built for the following reasons:
* To practice fullstack development by tackling real-world application complexity
  
* To redesign and improve the Whataburger website's UI/UX out of personal passion as a former employee and longtime fan of the brand

### Original website
